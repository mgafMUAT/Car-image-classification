This is a demonstration Python 3 program that demonstrates the process of preprocessing a dataset of car images, in order to train a multilayer perceptron model.
## The dataset
The dataset utilized in this app is the Cars Dataset provided publicly by the Stanford University, available [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html).
